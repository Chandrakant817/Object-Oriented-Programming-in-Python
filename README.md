### About OOP's

Object oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. It is used to design the program using classes and objects. The object is related to real-world entities such as book, house, etc.
The oops concept focuses on writing the reusable code. It is a widespread technique to solve the problem by creating objects.
